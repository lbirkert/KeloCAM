Simple and easy-to-use CAM software for hobbyists and semi-professionals

<br>

## About this Project

KeloCAM is CNC/CAM software written to make CNC routing and milling more approachable to the average user. It was written in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) using the new [WebGPU](https://wgpu.rs) technology. The UI code is provided by [egui](https://egui.rs), a robust intermediate UI framework.

<br>

## What We have Today

Since KeloCAM is in very-very-early stages it is lacking a ton of essential features and is basically unuseable. It should not be used in any production environment. Parts that are finished include
- The editor UI base

<br>

## Planned Features

1. Easy-to-use Toolpath generation.
2. Drag and Drop STL files.
3. Support many different CNCs.
4. Preview Toolpath before executing.
5. Monitor the CNC process.
